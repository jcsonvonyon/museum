      "In 1936 a revolt of the army led to a civil war in Spain that lasted several years and caused great suffering for the population. A relief programme carried out by SCI volunteers was set up in order assist civilians in the Spanish Civil War: evacuation of refugees and food programmes for children and old people. The campaign leader later wrote a book with the peculiar title {It did not start in Spain}, with which he wanted to point out the peace work of SCI.",

      "In the 1940's, most of SCI’s work came to a halt because of the Second World War. The British branch, International Volunteer Service (IVSP), remained very active on its soil - by providing the possibility of an alternative service for conscientious objectors - and it then became very much involved in the post-war effort abroad after the war, sending many volunteers throughout the shattered continent. A succession of workcamps organized in Germany, Netherlands, Italy, and Greece paved the way for the creation of SCI groups.",

      "Convinced of his method of peacebuilding, Pierre Ceresole initiated a first relief project outside Europe. Four European volunteers travelled to India in 1934 to help resettle villages threatened by flooding after an earthquake. Beyond the physical work, SCI thus promoted cooperation between the British colonial authorities and the Indian independence movement. The letters in which Ceresole reported on his travels in India were published in three books. SCI's work in India (and Pakistan) continued around 1950, after independence and partition.",

This unique mixed group of Algerian and French volunteers intended to improve living conditions of the local population. In the slums of Berardi in Alger, SCI volunteers organized school for children, improved roads and created urban social centers. These Activities became more and more difficult, as the war for independence started in 1954.",

One of the ideas discussed at the conference came from Swiss engineer Pierre Ceresole. He wanted to form an international group of volunteers who would do practical reconstruction work, working and living together in a spirit of peace and friendship. ",

During the World War I, he publicly voiced his opposition to war for which he was sentenced to prison. Later he initiated international work camps to create post war reconciliation and became co-founder of SCI.  Well-connected and multilingual, he spread the vision of SCI worldwide",

The volunteers were to build temporary for the villagers and clear the farmland so that it could be used for cultivation again. The fact that three of the volunteers were German, was seen as crucial and symbolic for post war reconciliation. But authorities and some of the locals saw the presence of the Germans as an insult, which lead finally to decision of the group to abandon the workcamp in spring 1921.      ",

Volunteers cleared the Rhine valley plain after a heavy flood in 1927.",
